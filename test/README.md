# Unit Tests for DeallsJobsTest

This directory contains unit tests for the DeallsJobsTest application. The tests are designed to verify the core functionality of the application without modifying any existing code.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized by package, mirroring the structure of the main application:

- `test/utils`: Tests for utility functions
- `test/services`: Tests for service layer functions

## Testing Approach

Since we couldn't modify the existing code, the tests focus on verifying the logic of the functions rather than their interactions with external dependencies like databases and Redis. This approach allows us to test the core business logic without needing to mock complex dependencies.

For each component, we've created tests that:

1. Verify the mathematical calculations (e.g., prorated salary, overtime pay)
2. Verify the date and time handling logic
3. Verify the data transformation logic (e.g., constructing response objects)

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./test/...
```

To run tests for a specific package:

```bash
go test ./test/utils
go test ./test/services
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
go test ./test/utils -run TestGetWorkingDaysInMonth
go test ./test/services -run TestProratedSalaryCalculation
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following components:

### Utils
- Date helper functions (calculating working days in a month)
- Global helper functions (random salary generation, pagination)

### Services
- Period service (date calculations for attendance periods)
- Payslip service (salary calculations, overtime pay, take-home pay)
- Payroll service (response construction, pagination)

## Future Improvements

For more comprehensive testing, consider:

1. Using a mocking library to properly mock GORM and Redis
2. Setting up a test database for integration tests
3. Adding tests for controllers and middleware
4. Implementing test coverage reporting
